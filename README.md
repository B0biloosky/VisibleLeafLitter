# VisibleLeafLitter
A Minecraft texture pack that make leaf litter more visible.

# !!! IMPORTANT !!!
The reason I made this was because I play on a server where we like to prank eachother by filling eachother's structures with leaf litter. If you play on that server (you know who you are) use this texture pack ONLY to place, and NEVER to break, it is completely dishonorable, and if you do this then you suck >:(
